# Sequential-Spatial-Killing
 
This project attempts to explore general death rates and killing patterns in a spatially structured ecosystem.

We have several species, each with their own 'predator' or 'antibiotic', and the antibiotics are fed in from the boundaries one at a time. It's possible for a resistant species to sheild another from the antibiotic, and it might be interesting if there's a magic number of species at which the number of waves of predation dramatically increases.

## Project Structure
